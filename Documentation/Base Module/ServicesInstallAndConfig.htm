<h1>eShopCONNECT Windows and Web Services</h1>
<h2>Installation and configuration</h2>
<p><a name="Installation">Installation</a></p>
<p>In order to use eShopCONNECT, you must make sure you have installed the eShopCONNECT Windows Service and 
Web Service components on your server.  If you are using Interprise Suite in a hosted environment, you need 
to request that Interprise Solutions enable these components for you, otherwise if you are running Interprise 
Suite on your own servers, you need to install these optional components on your server by running the Interprise 
Installer and selecting the eShopCONNECT Windows Service and Web Service components.</p>

<p><a name="Configuration">Configuration</a></p>
<p>Once installed, you need to edit the configuration files for both the eShopCONNECT Windows Service and 
Web Service so that they point to your Interprise Suite database.  Start the Interprise Application Configuration Tool 
which can be found in the Interprise Suite 6.0/Tools folder on your Start menu.</p>
<p>When the Application Configuration Tool opens, click on the Open/Configuration File menu item 
which should open the folder where Interprise Suite was installed.  By default this will be C:\Program Files\Interprise Solutions\Interprise Suite 6.0, 
or C:\Program Files (x86)\Interprise Solutions\Interprise Suite 6.0 if your computer is a 64 bit machine.  
Select the Lerryn.WindowsService.eShopCONNECT.exe.config file and click Open.</p>
<img src="EnableEditingOfConfig1.png">
<p>Set the Selected checkbox to enable editing of the Config File and then select the Company Setup tab.</p>
<img src="EnableEditingOfConfig2.png">
<p>Click on the elipsis button (highlighted in red) to enable editing of the SQL Server connection settings.</p>
<img src="EnableEditingOfConfig3.png">
<p>Enter the name of your SQL Server and the name of your Interprise company database.  We strongly recommend 
that you use SQL Server Authentication and enter the SQL Server login details that the eShopCONNECT Windows Service is to 
use to connect to the database.  If you wish to use Windows Authentication, then you will need to create a Windows User 
for the eShopCONNECT Windows Service to use and change the login settings for the eShopCONNECT Windows Service to login as that user.  
This is because the Local System account which the eShopCONNECT Windows Service uses by default normally cannot connect to SQL Server.</p>
<p>Click Test Connection to check that the connection details are correct, then click OK to close the Database Connection form.</p>
<p>Enter the Interprise User Code and related password that eShopCONNECT should use to login to your Interprise company and click the Test button adjacent to the Password to check the settings are correct</p>
<p>We strongly recommend that you create a separate Interprise User for eShopCONNECT and DO NOT use the default Admin user.  This is because Interprise Suite does not permit the same user to login on more than one computer at a time and this can result in login conflicts between the eShopCONNECT Windows Service and the Admin user.</p>
<p>Click Save on the Configuration Tool for Interprise Suite form to save the connection settings 
for the eShopCONNECT Windows Service.</p>
<p>To edit the configuration file for the eShopCONNECT Web Service, click on the 
Open/Configuration File menu item again.&nbsp; Again this should open the folder where Interprise 
Suite was installed.&nbsp; This time select the WebService directory and click 
the Open button, then select the eShopCONNECT directory and click&nbsp; the Open 
button, then select the Web.config file and click the Open button again.</p>
<p>Set the eShopCONNECT Web Service configuration exactly as you did for the eShopCONNECT Windows Service above.</p>
